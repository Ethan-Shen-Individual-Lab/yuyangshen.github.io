                    <p><strong>Shen, Y.</strong> Deep Reinforcement Learning for Financial Trading: A Diffusion-Enhanced Approach. <em>Working Paper</em>.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper extends the Deep Direct Reinforcement Learning framework proposed by Deng et al. (2016) for financial signal representation and trading. The study explores architectural innovations by replacing the original financial feature representation layer with frontier generative models. An attention layer is integrated into the main trading action loop, with modifications to the fully connected layers and hyperparameters designed to improve generalization across diverse trading scenarios. The enhanced architecture demonstrates improved performance in capturing complex market dynamics and generating robust trading signals.</p>

                    <p><strong>Shen, Y.</strong> Bridging Ordinary Least Squares and Deep Neural Networks: A Generalized Framework for Statistical Learning. <em>Working Paper</em>.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>Abstract:</strong> This study develops a generalized methodological framework establishing theoretical connections between Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and deep learning architectures. Building upon Goulet Coulombe's (2025) work linking OLS with attention mechanisms, we address two restrictive conditions that limit practical applicability: (i) orthogonalization requirements between training and test set weight matrices, and (ii) simplification to identity activation functions. To enable broader generalization, we introduce novel regularization terms in the loss function and design specialized activation functions that preserve the OLS-deep learning correspondence under more relaxed conditions. Furthermore, we investigate whether equivalence relationships can be established between OLS and other deep learning architectures beyond attention mechanisms under specific parameterizations. This work provides theoretical foundations for interpretable deep learning and offers practical guidance for model selection in statistical learning applications.</p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>Summary:</strong> Developed a GPT-based AI Agent on APPL framework to automate quantitative factor discovery lifecycle. The system comprises three specialized agents: FactorAgent, CalculatorAgent, and CodeAgent. This automated system reduced factor development time from weeks to hours and consistently generated factors with Information Coefficient (IC) above 0.07.</p>

                    <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><strong>Summary:</strong> Developed Hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (H-PPO) model for stock return prediction, designed to capture both short and long term signals. The model was benchmarked against LSTM, DNN, and GAN baselines across multiple market index stocks, achieving state-of-the-art results in key metrics including IC, Rank IC, RMSE, and Winning Rate. It also demonstrated superior training efficiency compared to SAMBA.</p>
