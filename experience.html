                        <li><strong>SAMBA:</strong> Replicated SAMBA (Mehrabian et al., arXiv:2410.03707) to forecast stock excess returns. This model integrates Bidirectional Mamba architecture with Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to capture complex temporal patterns. Performed hands-on implementation in Python, covering experiment design and benchmarking against traditional machine learning approaches, ultimately achieving superior forecasting accuracy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dynamic Factor Model:</strong> Implemented Dynamic Factor Model (DFM) within a state-space framework to extract latent economic signals. Developed a novel estimation procedure by framing DFM as a differentiable model, enabling parameter inference via gradient-based optimization of a custom loss function.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Peking University PHBS (Research Assistant)</h3>
                    <p><strong>2024.12 - 2025.5</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>LLM-Powered Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Developed a pipeline to analyze 240,000 e-commerce reviews for regression analysis on review helpfulness. Feature set includes: (1) AI-Generated Metrics: Fine-tuned BERT model to score 28 emotional dimensions (e.g., disappointment), and a prompted LLM (DeepSeek V3 API) to extract 9 granular metrics (e.g., objectivity, effort, readability); (2) Control Variables: Over 30 controls capturing review linguistics (log word count, capital ratio), reviewer history (expert reviewer), product attributes (product popularity), and product category fixed effects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Web Scraping and Econometrics:</strong> Collected entertainment industry data via web scraping (Selenium, Requests) and constructed behavioral indicators for empirical analysis. Employed panel regression and instrumental variables to quantitatively assess the impact of individual behavior on industry metrics, validating results with robustness and heterogeneity checks.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Internship Experience</h2>
